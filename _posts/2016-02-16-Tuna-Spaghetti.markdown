This recipe is really my dad's brainchild, with a few of my own tweaks. I've used red wine in this version of the recipe, but if you're on a budget, it's best to leave the wine and the chorizo out. It's still totally yummy without them, and healthier. If you want to add more veggies, I recommend peppers, celery, mushrooms. I make this in advance, and add it to pasta or cous cous during the week.

Servings: 4 medium portions

Time: 45 minutes

Cost: €11.14 for all ingredients (€17.64 with wine), €3.33 for a pot (€5.03 with wine), €0.83 per serving (€1.26 with wine)

Ingredients: 

  * 1 large onion
  * 3 garlic cloves (reduce if you're not a garlic enthusiast)

  * 2 tins tuna 160g each

Start by chopping your onion, garlic, and chorizo. Put the onion in a pot with a little oil.

After the onion has softened for a few minutes, add the finely chopped garlic and sliced chorizo.

Fry this off, stirring regularly, for 5 minutes or so. Add the 2 teaspoons mixed herbs and 1/2 teaspoon chilli flakes.

Add the chopped tomatoes, the 3 tablespoons tomato purée, and the beef stock cube.

Drain the cans of tuna, but not completely, because you want some of the brine to flavour the dish. Scoop the tuna into the pot and mix with the other ingredients.

Add the red wine and continue cooking on a medium heat for 15-20 minutes.

Serve on any kind of pasta. Spaghetti remains my favourite, but you can also try different kinds of base - courgetti, cous cous, quinoa.
