This recipe was invented by my Grandma, so all the credit will have to go to her. She used to make this when my family visited her, and I can vivdly remember sitting at the dining table in her kitchen, eating lemon chicken, carrots, and green beans. It's a really delicious recipe.

Servings: 3-4 

Time: 20 minutes prep, 90 minutes cooking

Cost: €4.96, €1.65 per serving (please note the chicken I got was on offer)

Ingredients: 

  * 3 chicken breasts (500g or so)
  * 1 chicken stock cube
  * Juice of 1 lemon or 5 tbsps bottled lemon juice
  * Flour - 10g needed to coat the chicken, but they're easier to coat if you pour out 50g
  * sage - fresh or dried, to taste (I use 2 tbsps)

Equipment:

  * Frying pan
  * Baking tray

Preheat the oven to 150C fan. Dice or slice your chicken breast into chunks or strips, whichever you prefer. Coat each piece in flour and bung them into the frying pan.

Cook the chicken so that you can't see any pink raw meat. Don't cook it on too high heat though, because you don't want to brown it either. While that's cooking you can make up your stock. You'll need around 400ml. Add the lemon juice to the stock.

When there is no more raw chicken exposed, pop them into a large baking tray, preferebly glass. Pour the stock over the chicken. If the stock isn't covering the chicken you can add some hot water. Then add your fresh or dried sage. I'm using dried because I don't have any herb pots currently!

Put in the oven for 90 minutes at 150C (fan oven). I recommend pairing with carrots and beans, but this goes well with rice, potatoes, pasta, and pretty much any veg.
