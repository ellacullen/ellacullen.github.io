I first had these pancakes while on holiday in Morocco. I fell in love with them, and had them every day for breakfast for two weeks. That was two years ago, and I can’t believe I didn’t look up the recipe sooner! I highly recommend taking a trip to Morocco for the real deal, but until then, try these out. 

Servings: 20-25 small pancakes

Time: 45 minutes

Cost: €0.99, €0.05 per serving

Calories: 1,303 kcal, 52 per pancake

Ingredients:  

*	240g semolina

*	120g plain flour

*	1 teaspoon salt

*	1 teaspoon sugar

*	2 teaspoons baking powder

*	1 tablespoon yeast

*	700ml lukewarm water

Equipment:

*	Large mixing bowl

*	Blender

*	Measuring jug

*	Weighing scales

*	Frying pan/skillet

Start by putting your 700ml of lukewarm water (make sure it’s not too hot, or it will kill the yeast) and pour it into your blender. Add your sugar and yeast and leave for 5 minutes.

Combine your flour, semolina, salt, and baking powder in a large mixing bowl or jug.

Blend the yeast mixture very lightly for a few seconds until it has mixed and has a few bubbles on top.

Add the dry ingredients gradually, in 5-6 sections, blending after each addition. The resulting batter should be very smooth and runny. Pour the batter into a large mixing bowl (I used the same one I used for my dry ingredients) and cover with cling film. Leave to rest for 30 minutes.

During this time, get the kids up, shower and dress, contemplate existence, or go back to bed for an extra half an hour. 

Now grab a pan and heat some oil. Use a ladle or a large soon to pour splotches of batter into the hot pan. These pancakes are only cooked on one side.

The pancake on the right is done, while the one on the left is nearly done, but has some gooey-ness left on top. When that dries, it’s done!

Admire your hard work. Or, alternatively, just stuff your face with warm goodness. I like these best with butter and jam or honey. Enjoy!
