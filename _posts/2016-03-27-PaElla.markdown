This is my take on a paella. Its really yummy, even if it does take some time. The ingredients are all healthy and cheap, especially if you don't add the meat. This is easy to make vegetarian or vegan, and will be just as delicious!

Servings: 4 medium portions

Time: 60-80 minutes

Cost: €13.26 for all ingredients, €5.94 for 4 servings, €1.48 per serving (€1.26 with wine)

Ingredients: 

  * 1 large onion
  * 2 garlic cloves 
  * 200g paella rice
  * 2"-3" chorizo (otional - not included in calorie or price calculatons)
  * 1 teaspoon chilli flakes
  * 1/2 teaspoon paprika
  * 2 medium chicken breasts
  * mushrooms (1/4 tub)
  * 1/2 red pepper
  * handful of frozen peas
  * 1 tablespoon tomato puree
  * juice of 1 lemon (3-4 tablespoons)
  * 1 chicken stock cube
  * 3 tablespoons tomato purée

Equipment:

  * Pot 
  * Frying pan

Start by chopping your onion and garlic. Add to a frying pan with a drizzle of oil, or use a dry pan. Add the chili flakes and some paprika. Make up 400 - 500ml of chicken stock.

After the onion has softened for a few minutes, add the chorizo. While this is cooking, get your chicken breasts poaching. The fastest way is to boil a kettle, half-fill a big pot with the boiling water, and add the breasts. Make sure they are covered by the water. Cook on a high heat with a lid for 20 minutes or so - you can have this going in the background while you prepare the rest of the paella.

When the onions are looking a little crispy, add the paella rice.

Lightly fry the paella rice for a minute. It will go from the pale white to a golden colour as it soaks up the oil. When it is golden, add a little of the stock. Continue to add stock an cook it off a little at a time. During this time, slice your mushrooms and red pepper. At some point (when you do this is not too important) add the tablespoon of tomato puree.

Continue adding and reducing the stock. This should take at least 20 minutes. Don't try and rush it. The pan should be on a medium heat the whole time. When you are nearing the end of the cooking time - the rice should be still a little too crunchy - drain the chicken breats. Rinse any residue off and shred the breasts using two forks.

Add your peppers and mushrooms.

Cook these in a little, then add the chicken, and finally the peas. Cook for a further 5 minutes or so, until everything is well mixed.
