Time: 60 minutes

Cost: €17.92 for all ingredients, €5.68 for a tray of brownies, €0.28 per brownie

Calories: 4,406 kcal for the whole tray (so acceptable to eat in one sitting), 220 kcal per brownie

Ingredients: 

  * 80g butter
  * 100g dark chocolate
  * 100g plain chocolate
  * 100g milk chocolate
  * 150g golden syrup
  * 2 eggs
  * 200g plain flour
  * 3/4 tsp baking powder
  * 50g granulated sugar
  * 2 tsps cocoa powder
  * 100g white chocolate

Equipment:

  * Baking tray
  * Weighing scales

Preheat the oven to 150C (fan). Start by breaking up your dark, plain, and milk chocolate and adding it to a large saucepan. Add the 80g butter and 150g golden syrup. Melt it all together on a low heat.

While this is melting, combine the dry ingredients - 200g plain flour, 3/4 tsp baking powder, 50g granulated sugar and 2 tsps cocoa powder.

When the chocolate has fully melted, add to the flour mix and combine thoroughly by folding it throught the flour. 

Add the 2 eggs, and mix thoroughly. If the mix seems a bit dry (very hard to stir) add a splash of milk.

Chop up your white chocolate and add to the mix. Give it a good stir, then pour into a greaseproof paper-lined baking tray. Pop into the oven for 25 minutes (or until a skewer comes out clean).
