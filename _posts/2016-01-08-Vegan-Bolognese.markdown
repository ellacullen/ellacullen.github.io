I love bolognese. My mum used to make it with so much veg that I didn't like it, because it wasn’t like the bolognese in my friend’s houses. Little did I realise that the reason it was different was because she made the sauce from scratch, and therefore it was much healthier. This recipe is even healthier and cheaper because there's no meat, although you can definitely add meat if you want.

Ingredients:  

  * 1 tin kidney beans

  * 1 tin chopped tomatoes

  * 1 packet passata

  * 2 small courgettes

  * 2 teaspoons oregano

  * 1 large onion

  * 2 cloves of garlic

  * 1 beef or veg stock cube

  * 2 tablespoons tomato puree

  * dash of paprika

  * some fresh basil

  * fresh chillies (optional)

  * olives (optional)

Equipment:

  * Frying pan

  * Pot

I recommend chopping your onion, garlic and courgette at the beginning. Add the onion and garlic into a frying pan with some oil.

Next add in your chillies (if you’re using them, I’m a chilli fiend!) and your oregano.

Add in half the fresh basil. You can leave this to the end if you want. I like to start infusing the basil flavour very early.

When the onions and garlic have fried off enough, about 5-10 minutes of cooking, add in your chopped courgette.

The courgette should be left to fry for about 10 minutes, stirring regularly. I really need to get a bigger pan! In the meantime, drain and rinse your kidney beans. You don’t need to add kidney beans, I add them for the protein, but you could swap them for more veggies! I recommend mushrooms, peppers, or celery.

Add the tomato passata, chopped toms, and 400ml stock to the beans and heat to a simmer. When it’s hot, add the contents of the frying pan. I recommend cooking on a medium heat until it’s all nice and hot and has had a chance to infuse and get all tomato-y and wonderful.

I added a couple of black olives right at the end, and served piled onto hot organic spaghetti with cheese and fresh basil on top.

Tuck in!
