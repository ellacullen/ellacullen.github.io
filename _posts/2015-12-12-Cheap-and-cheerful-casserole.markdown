This is a recent favourite. I found a similar recipe that made use of ham, mint and peas. However, I had no ham and a bunch of leftover roast chicken, so I decided to transform it a bit. I also snuck in extra veggies, as I find when I buy them, they’re always in a multipack and I really struggle to get through veg quickly. Feel free to adapt my recipe further to your own tastes!

Ingredients:  
  - 1 onion
  - 1 garlic clove 
  - 1 chicken or veg stock cube
  - 350g potatoes (fresh or tinned)
  - 160g carrots (fresh or tinned)
  - 90g chopped celery (about three stalks)
  - 80g kale
  - 150g peas (frozen is usually cheapest)
  - 100g chicken (leave out for vegetarians/vegans)
  - a few sprigs of mint

Equipment:
-	Frying pan
-	Pot
-	Blender

Start by chopping up your onion, garlic, and celery. Break up your chicken with your fingers and place in a bowl. This is really good for leftover roast chicken, but you could also buy some chicken breast. Pop the onion, garlic, celery and chicken in a frying pan with some oil. If you prefer softer onion, fry it for 5 minutes before adding the other ingredients.

Leave that frying while you make up 400-500ml chicken/veg stock. The volume of stock depends on how runny you’d like the casserole. I used 400ml, as I like a thick casserole. Pour the stock into a big pot and heat to a simmer. Chop up your mint and add to the pot. 

Remember to check on your onion/garlic/chicken/celery!

If you’re using fresh potatoes and carrots, was and chop them. I used tins, as I wanted to avoid leftover veg. Add the taters and carrots to the stock and cook until soft (5 minutes for tinned, 20 for fresh). 

Take out half the potatoes and half the stock and add to a blender/food processor. This step is actually optional, but it makes for a thicker sauce for the casserole, instead of a weak soup. After blitzing the potatoes and stock, pour back into the pot. 

Add the contents of the frying pan to the pot and stir in. Add the kale and the peas, and cook for a further 10 minutes. Serve yourself a huge bowl of steaming hot, guilt-free deliciousness.
