Quick and easy to make, these are a lifesaver for snacks. They're also cheap, and can be made vegan by swapping the egg for a linseed egg - ground linseed/flaxseed and water. The recipe is also very scalable.

Servings: 8 little cookies

Time: 30 minutes

Cost: €8.82 for all ingredients, €1.63 for 8 cookies, €0.20 per cookie

Calories: The whole recipe is 719 kcal, making each cookie 89 kcal. You can reduce this by halving the oats - the mixture is wetter but still yummy!

Blend on high power for a few minutes. In the meantime, mash your banana thoroughly. This recipe is a great use for old, soft bananas.

When your oats are finished they should be quite fine, but still a little grainy.
