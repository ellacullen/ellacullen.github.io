This recipe strays quite a lot from traditional chili. It’s sort of the holier-than-thou version of the classic, but in my opinion, it’s a great excuse to eat chili every night of the week. It’s also full of veggies, cheap, and vegan. If you need that meaty buzz, just add in mince à la traditional chili.

Ingredients: 
  * 1 onion
  * 1 garlic clove 
  * 1-4 fresh chilies
  * 1 tin kidney beans
  * 1 tin chopped tomatoes
  * 160g kale
  * 90g celery (about three stalks)
  * 1/2 packet passata
  * Spices: coriander, cajun, paprika

Equipment:
  * Pot

Start by chopping up your onion and garlic and put in a pan with a little oil. While they start frying, chop up your fresh chilies. Take care doing this, and use gloves. I used finger chilies. If you’re new to chilies, only use a very small amount – max. 1 chopped chili. Add your chilies to the pot.

Now add your celery and cook for 5-10 minutes. You could also add peppers or carrots at this step.

Now drain and add your kidney beans, followed by the chopped tomatoes and half a packet of passata. While this heats up, prep your kale by washing and chopping it. I know kale is not a typical addition, but I wanted to see if it works better in chili than it does in smoothies!

When the sauce is bubbling, and the kale and cook for a further 10 minutes on a low heat. 

Finally, add a couple more whole chilies, if you are a crazy person like me. Serve with rice or in a big comforting bowl all on its own. I highly recommend adding some cheese, vegan cheese if you can get it!
