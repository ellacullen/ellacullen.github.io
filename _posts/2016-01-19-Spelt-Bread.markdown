This recipe is one my mum was given years ago, and has since been altered a lot. I recommend using plain spelt flour first to see if you like it, then try wholemeal. I prefer wholemeal as it’s lower calories, has more fibre and is tastier. You can make different versions of this bread, and I’ll post suggestions as I try them, in very short blogs. 

Note: You can buy xanthum gum at most health food stores, I couldn't find it in Tesco.

Servings: 18 thin slices

Time: 70-90 minutes

Cost for ingredients: €12.31, or €0.68 per slice

Calories: Per loaf 1,403 kcal or 1,347 kcal, 78 kcal or 74 kcal per slice

Ingredients: 

  * 350g spelt flour (plain or wholemeal)   €2.89 1kg plain (use €0.87) or €3.15 1kg wholemeal (use €0.95)
  * 250ml buttermilk    €0.79 (use €0.19)
  * ½ tsp xanthum gum   €3.04 (use €0.04)
  * ¼ tsp salt  €0.45 (use €0.000 something, very small amount)
  * 1 tsp baking soda   €1.25 (use €0.01)
  * ½ tsp baking powder   €1.74 (use €0.01)
  * 1 egg   €1.89 (use €0.315)


Equipment:

  * Big mixing bowl
  * Bread tin
  * Weighing scales

Preheat your oven to 150C (fan). Weigh out the dry ingredients (flour, xanthum gum, salt, baking soda, baking powder).

Mix these dry ingredients together thoroughly, and then add the egg and buttermilk and mix very thoroughly with a wooden spoon.

The mix should be very sticky and quite dry, but try and keep mixing until your arm falls off.

Pour/scoop the mixture into a small bread tin – I line mine with greaseproof paper, but you don’t need to, some butter or oil works too.

Put in the oven for 50-60 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean.

Below is the above recipe, but with 50g spelt flour substituted for 50g gram flour (high in protein) and 100g parmesan and 2 tsps chilli flakes added. Delicious!
