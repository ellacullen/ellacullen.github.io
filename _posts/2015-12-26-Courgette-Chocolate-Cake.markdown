My mum used to make this when I was younger, as a way of sneaking extra veggies into us. The courgette also makes quite a wet, dense mix, which makes this a very moist cake that you can leave out on the counter top for a few days - if it lasts that long!

Servings: One loaf tin, 10 slices or so

TIme: 60-90 minutes

Cost: €3.42, €0.34 per serving

Ingredients: 

  * 2 small courgettes

  * 100g plain flour

  * 1 teaspoon baking powder

  * 45g caster sugar

  * 1 teaspoon vanilla essence

  * 100g dark chocolate

  * 100g milk chocolate

  * white chocolate for topping (optional)

  * tablespoon rum (optional)

Equipment:

  * Grater

  * Bread tin 

  * Mixing bowl

Start by grating your courgette. I use the smallest side of the grater, meaning the courgette is very fine. Put your courgette into a large mixing bowl.

Break up your milk and dark chocolate and pop into a microwave-safe bowl. Technically you should melt your chocolate in a bain-marie (a bowl over boiling water), but microwaving is easier! So pop the chocolate in the microwave for 1 minute on a medium heat. If it's too hot, the chocolate will burn.

In the meantime, add 100g flour, 45g sugar, and 1 teaspoon baking powder into the mixing bowl. I have no gluten-free flour at the moment, but this should work with rice flour or coconut flour, it just won't raise as much. If you're going gluten-free, remember to leave out the baking powder too, it's not coeliac-friendly!

Mix the courgette and dry ingredients as thoroughly as possible, it should clump a bit due to the wetness of the courgette. Start pre-heating your oven now (150 C fan).

Take out your chocolate and stir. Pop in for another minute and stir again. It shouldn't need more than two minutes, if there are some lumps try to melt them just by stirring vigorously. Add the chocolate to the mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. Add one teaspoon of vanilla essence and mix.

Suddenly re-think the amount of chocolate and add some extra chunks... (last minute calories don't count)

Pour the mix into a pre-greased and lined bread tin. I line the bread tin lenghtways with baking parchment as it makes it a lot easier to get the cake out! Bake in a pre-heated oven at 150 C for 30-45 minutes.

Take it out of the oven and put on a cooling rack, or a plate, if (like me) you don't have such fancy equipment. Melt some white chocolate while the cake is cooling. Put the melted white chocolate into a sandwich bag. Yup, you heard me. Not everyone can pay 50 cent for a single piping bag, and it turns out that sandwich bags are a pretty handy alternative. Squish the melty chocolate into a corner of the bag and tie it off.

Cut the corner of the bag. Try to only cut a little off, it will give a thinner flow and allow you more control. Then proceed to decorate your cake however you like! I'm a bit haphazard....

Tuck in!
